# Dual-VCDCO-monosynth
- A monosynth based on the Hagiwo $9 VCO and the AS3372 Matrix 12 filter
Having purchased some Seeed XIAO RP2040 boards to build a polysynth and not using them, I decided to give the HAGIWO $9 VCO a try on its own.
Once I got it stable and nice sounding I decided it would make a good base for a dual oscillator monosynth and this was created.
